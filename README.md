# User Guide

> Credit where credit is due. Dumper inspired by the amasing work done by [John Reeves](https://github.com/jonnyreeves) on [JS-Logger](https://github.com/jonnyreeves/js-logger). So why another logger? See Appendix.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Keep in mind**: Dumper is a wrapper for console thus its fuctions work pretty much the same and can simple replace console with a simple find/replace or valiable assignment.
